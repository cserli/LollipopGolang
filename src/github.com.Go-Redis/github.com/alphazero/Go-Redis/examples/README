Examples always use DBs 10 and/or 13 and assume you have set the password in redis.conf to "go-redis".  

If you are using either DB 10 or 13 for your own data make sure you change the ConnectionSpec details in the examples files, as the database may be flushed. 

To build and run the examples, invoke the run cmd file with name of the example file (without extension).
Note that you must first make and install go-redis (redis package).  See readme in the package directory for details.

ex:
./run ciao
